# TriviaGame-
In this assignment, I created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

You have a set timer that will count down to end the game. You must answer all the questions before the timer hit zero. 

If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and end the game. 

On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
